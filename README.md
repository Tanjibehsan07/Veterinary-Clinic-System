# Veterinary-Clinic-System

## Project Overview

Many veterinary clinics provide medical services but lack integrated foster care and adoption programs for homeless pets. Managing pet medical history, fostering services, and adoption processes manually is inefficient. This system aims to create a centralized platform for efficient pet healthcare, temporary fostering, and permanent adoptions, ensuring better animal welfare.

## Objectives

- **Provide efficient medical record management for pets.**

- **Implement an online appointment booking system.**

- **Develop a paid foster care system with secure payments.**

- **Create an adoption platform to match pets with adoptive families.**

- **Ensure secure billing and client management for clinic operations.**

## Proposed Solution

### Technology Stack
- **Front-End**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-End**
  - PHP
- **Database**
  - MySQL

### Additional Tools & Libraries:

- **DOMPDF for generating downloadable bills and reports**

- **CSS frameworks for enhanced styling and responsiveness.**

### Core Features

- **Appointment booking**

- **Medical records management**

- **Paid foster program with secure payments**

- **Adoption portal**

- **Innovative Aspects**

- **Integration of veterinary care + paid fostering + adoption, ensuring comprehensive pet welfare management.**

## Methodology

- **Development Approach:**
   Agile methodology

- **System Architecture:**
  Web-based system with role-based access (Admins, Pet Owners, Adopters)

- **Expected Challenges & Risks:**
